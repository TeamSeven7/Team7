# We will be using the Arcade Game that Vicky recommended.
Firstly, We need to check out the important aspects of the game:
    1.Design- Includes the designing of the players and all that.
    2.Logic- What happens when the player shoots at an opponent, when he collects some powerup,etc.
    3.Number of Players- Need to discuss
    4.The softwares i.e, the backend and front end to be used- Need to discuss.
    5.I hope those are all the questions that need to be answered.
