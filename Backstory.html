        <p>
           The planets once lived in harmony just existing in the cosmos.But billions of years later they were inhabited by humans who lived on each of these planets.
           The planets cooperated together for the benefit of everyone.
           But 100 years later greed overcame these beings .
           Resources started depleting as a result of this greed.And the powerful suppressed the weak.
           In this pursuit the planets inhabitants became cruel towards other planets in order to seek more resources.
           This caused the  great war to take place between the planets.
           This ended in many people loosing their lives.
           At the end of all of this there was a joint decision taken by the governments of these respective planets.
           The decision was to keep a battle for the resources ,where each planet fought against the others to attain a grand prize which would ensure these planets to enjoy resources for 100 years which the losing planets would give them .
           Champions from each of these planets would battle in ships that represented their planets.
           And the name of this battle was LASER OPS.
