<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> 
<font size="+1">Once upon a time, the planets all lived in harmony, just existing in the cosmos. 
But billions of years later, all the planets were inhabited by humans. Despite disagreement towards the change,
the planets cooperated together for the benefit of everyone.


<font size="+2"><br><strong><em>But 100 years later greed overcame these beings.</em></strong></font>


<br>Resources started depleting as a result of this greed. And the powerful suppressed the weak. 
In this pursuit, the planet's inhabitants became cruel towards other planets in order to seek more resources. 
This caused the great war to take place between the planets which resulted in the loss of many lives. 
At the end of it all, there was a joint decision taken by the governments of the respective planets.
The decision was to keep a battle for the resources, where each planet fights with a standard weapon, 
the <strong>lazer staber </strong>, for a grand prize which would permit the winning planet to enjoy resources
of all the others, for the next 100 years. Champions from each of these planets would battle in ships that 
represented their planets. This lead to the greatest war of all times,</span></p>
